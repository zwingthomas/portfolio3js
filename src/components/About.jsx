        I am a skilled Site Reliability Engineer who recently received a certification for architecture through
        the Professional Google Cloud Architect examination. I am also heading up a team of engineers who are working
        to develop personal projects together in order to accomplish great things through the power of team work. It has
        been an invaluable experience and my paired programming abilities as well as my mentorship and leadership skills have been honed
        immesurably. It is amazing what one can accomplish with the power of a community behind you. Let me know if you
